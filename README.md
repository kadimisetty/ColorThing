## Credits:

Thanks to Rob Cavazos (of PSY/OPS etc.) for
pointing out Glyph 3's shortcomings when it
comes to color label navigation, especially the
inability to use a keyboard shortcut to swap the
currently edited glyph with the next/previous
one assigned to the same color label. While
this plugin has yet to finish solving that particular
problem, it alleviates it somewhat by providing
the ability to keep a better view of the current
color labels in the sidebar and making it possible
to open a new tab with all glyphs assigned to the
same color label.
