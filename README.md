## Credits

Thanks to Rob Cavazos (PSY/OPS Type Foundry etc.)
for elucidating a Glyph 3's shortcoming with
color label navigation, in particular, that there
isn't a quick keyboard shortcut to rapidly swap
the currently edited glyph with the next/previous
one assigned to the same color label. While
this plugin has yet to finish solving that, it
alleviates the issue somewhat by providing the
ability to track color labels and the number of
assigned glyphs from the sidebar, and also making
it possible to open a new tab with all glyphs
assigned to a color label.
